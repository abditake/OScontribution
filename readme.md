# A checklist before you contribute

## When you’ve found a project you’d like to contribute to, do a quick scan to make sure that the project is suitable for accepting contributions. Otherwise, your hard work may never get a response.

## Here’s a handy checklist to evaluate whether a project is good for new contributors.

## **Meets the definition of open source**
- [] Does it have a license? Usually, there is a file called LICENSE in the root of the repository.
Project actively accepts contributions

#### Look at the commit activity on the main branch. On GitHub, you can see this information on a repository’s homepage.

- [] When was the latest commit?

- [] How many contributors does the project have?

- [] How often do people commit? (On GitHub, you can find this by clicking "Commits" in the top bar.)

## **Next, look at the project’s issues.**

- [] How many open issues are there?

- [] Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?

- [] Is there active discussion on the issues?

- [] Are the issues recent?

- [] Are issues getting closed? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Issues page to see closed issues.)
Now do the same for the project’s pull requests.


- [] How many open pull requests are there?

- [] Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when they are opened?

- [] Is there active discussion on the pull requests?

- [] Are the pull requests recent?

- [] How recently were any pull requests merged? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Pull Requests page to see closed PRs.)


## **Project is welcoming**

#### A project that is friendly and welcoming signals that they will be receptive to new contributors.


- [] Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?

- [] Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?

- [] Do pull requests get reviewed?

- [] Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?
